Iterative solution for 3 Rods(Pegs) :
        (Legal Move means example: A->B if A is larger than move disk from A to B else move B to A)
        disk is Even: then moves are
                            correct move from A -> B
                            correct move from A -> C
                            correct move from B -> c
        disk is Odd: then moves are
                            correct move from A -> C
                            correct move from A -> B
                            correct move from B -> C

        so number of moves is 2^n - 1 where n = number of disk


For more than 3 Rods(Pegs):
    Getting minimum move is so hard (Optimal Solution), couldn't able to solve it
    what I did was, First I put the smallest disk in Rods other than starting, middle and destination,
    then I did the same step as 3 rods for those disks left on starting rods, after I get all those
    left disk on destinationRod, I just move the disk on remaining rods to destinationRod.

    So number of move will be (2^k - 1) + 2m where m = number of  rods - 3
                                                   k = number of disk - m
